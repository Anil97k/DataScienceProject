# DataScienceProject
Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vocational rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds and many more. New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized  content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand. This project can help to predict the first travel destination of a new user based on his personalized content.
